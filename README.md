Also, the user will be able to create a wish list with books they want to read in the future, or a list that is already ready. The user will
be able to sure these lists if they want.

### 3. Structure

As the website has two main ideas, create reviews and wish lists, and I kept the website as simple as possible and easy to use.
Instead of create a lot a functionality and created a few functionality that make a lot o things.

- A part of the home page, everypage has the same structure to keep consistency and to make the navigation easy to assimilate.
